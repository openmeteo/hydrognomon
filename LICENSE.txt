This software is free software, but it needs to be linked to a
non-free library. Below we provide the license for the software in
legal language as well as a human-readable explanation of what you are
and what you are not allowed to do, the reasons for which the non-free
library is essential, and what you could do if you want to help us get
rid of the non-free library.

Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7:

If you modify this Program, or any covered work, by linking or
combining it with any Delphi Libraries, the licensors of this Program
grant you additional permission to treat these Delphi Libraries as
System Libraries within the meaning of the GNU GPL version 3 section
1, and therefore exclude them from the Corresponding Source.  "Delphi
Libraries" means (a) those files, libraries and/or source code that
are included in the packaging of Delphi with the intent of being
redistributed to the end user; and (b) updates to such files,
libraries and/or source code that are provided free of charge to
Delphi licensees.  "Delphi" means any edition of Borland Delphi 7,
Borland Delphi 2005, or any Delphi version later than Borland Delphi
2005 (including CodeGear Delphi 2009 and any later version).
Therefore, this provision allows you to link, for example, to versions
of the TEEChart library that are distributed with Delphi (or to free
updates of such versions), but not to other versions of the TEEChart
library.

DEFINITIONS

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

"The Program" refers to the Object Code licensed under this license.

GRANT OF LICENSE

We grant you a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to
install and execute the Program, without modification, for your own
internal use.

LIMITATIONS

You may not: (a) modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative
works of the Program or merge the Program with other software; (b)
lease, rent or loan the Program to any third party; (c) sublicense,
distribute or otherwise transfer the Program to any third party; (d)
reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to
derive the source code of the Program; (e) remove, alter, or obscure
any confidentiality or proprietary notices (including copyright and
trademark notices); or (f) reproduce or use the Program except as
expressly permitted in this license.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

There is no warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by
applicable law.  Except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright
holders and/or other parties provide the program "as is", without warranty
of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to,
the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
Program is with you.  Should the program prove defective, you assume
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or conveys
the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any
general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the
use or inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of
data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third
parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs),
even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the program in return for a fee.

2. Human-readable explanation
=============================

This section is informative; we make no warranty that it is free of
error, and you need to read the legal license terms to be
legally certain of the licensing terms and conditions.

If you are just a user who wants to use the software, then all you
need to know is that you are permitted to install the software in an
unlimited number of computers and have it used by an unlimited number
of users.  You are, however, not permitted to redistribute the
software to a third party - instead, you can tell to the third party
to download the software from us. The rest of this section is intended
for developers, or people who need more information and know what
"source" and "compiled" means.

Our software has largely been written in Delphi since 1997, and we
have a fairly large code base. We have re-written parts of that
software in Python (particularly the database management part), but
the part of the software that does math, such as time series
processing and hydrological modelling, cannot easily be rewritten in
another language or tool, and although we are keeping it open as an
option, we don't yet have the budget that would allow us to do it.  On
the other hand, last time we checked, Lazarus, a free Delphi
alternative, was too immature to let us contemplate porting our Delphi
software.

We therefore decided to make our Delphi software as closer to free as
possible, but without breaking its dependency on Delphi. This creates
two problems:

1) Free software requires free tools, and Delphi is not free.

2) Our software depends on Delphi libraries, which are not free. The
   license that comes with Delphi allows the Delphi developer to
   redistribute the Delphi libraries to the end user, but not to allow
   the end user further redistribution.  Therefore, although we give
   you our compiled software and would also like to allow you to give
   it to your friend, the license we have received with Delphi does
   not allow us to give you such permission, and therefore you should
   tell your friend to get the software from us.

As a result, if you are an end user and want to use the executable
version of our software, we are limited by the Delphi license, because
the executable includes the Delphi libraries. We permit you to use the
executable for your own internal purposes, but we can't permit you
anything else, including redistribution.

If you are a developer interested in the source code, things are
different: we give you our source code with GPL, with an additional
term that gives you the additional right to link it with the Delphi
libraries. You can then use Delphi to modify and compile our code. The
resulting binary will contain both our code and the Delphi libraries;
because it contains our code, which we licensed to you with GPL, you
need to also provide our source code and generally comply with the
GPL; and because it contains the Delphi libraries, you will also need
to comply with the license you have received with Delphi.  Of course,
if you find a way to use our code without linking to the Delphi
libraries, you will no longer be constrained by the Delphi license and
you will only need to comply with the GPL.

Ways in which you can help make our software entirely free include
improving Lazarus and porting our software to Lazarus. Some parts of
the software, such as the mathematical routines, should be easier to
migrate than the GUI part. Another way is to rewrite the whole beast
in another language or tool. Note that a few modules have already been
rewritten in Python (we call that Python library pthelma: it is
available at http://openmeteo.org/).
